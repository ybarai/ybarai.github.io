      Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease
      and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens
      have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their
      meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

    <h4 id="sushi">Sushi</h4><!-- Here is same id for two elements i.e. id="sushi" in one html file but at a time only one will be avtive so there will be no error. So it is acceptable.-->
    Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt,
    accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, and tropical fruits.
    Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi
    rice", also referred to as sumeshi. Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white
    rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often
    prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab
    meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi,
    and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon are popular garnishes for the dish.
